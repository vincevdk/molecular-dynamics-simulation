    Parameters:
    -----------
    vel: array of size (N_particle, 3)
       The velocity of N particles in 3 dimensions. The first index of the
       array corresponds to a particle.
    pos: array of size (N_particle, 3)
       The positon of N particles in 3 dimensions. The first index of the
       array corresponds to a particle.

    Results:
    -------
    pos:array of size (N_particle, 3)
       The positon of N particles in 3 dimensions. The first index of the array
       corresponds to a particle.
    vel:array of size (N_particle, 3)
       The velocity of N particles in 3 dimensions. The first index of the
       array corresponds to a particle.
    temperature_evolution: array of size (100)
       testfunction which shows what the temperature was before rescaling
       every loop. (not implemented in other parts of the code, except for
