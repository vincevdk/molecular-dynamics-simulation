# Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms
By Coen, Vincent and Peter-Jan

The file comp_1.pdf contains our report.

## How to run the code
The simulation can be run by typing in the command line `python simulation.py` The pair correlation function plot can be created by typing in the command line `python correlation_function_plot.py`
The compressibility plot can be created by typing `python compressibility_density_plot.py`
 
Input parameters can be changed in the file `config.py`
